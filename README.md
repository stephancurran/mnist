Using the MNIST dataset (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), I'm playing with machine learning in different languages (Octave, R, and Python so far.

Each file uses 'mnist.csv', which contains 42000 rows and no header (every row represents a digit); the first column is the label, and the remainder are the 784 (28x28) greyscale values of the digit.

There's no licence; if the files are useful to you, you're welcome to them.
